#First Week reflection

This week has been exciting and has changed the way I approach solving a problem
with code. Using the concepts of refacotring and test driven development have
helped me stay focused and accomplish one task at a time.  Here is a list of the
important topics that I have learned this week:

+Test Driven development
..+Unit testing
..+Setup of test files
..+Driving good code habits (tests before methods)
..+Writing code to result my intention (not what the code already does)
+Sandi Metz's Rules
..+How to refactor
..+The ease of testing this creates

It was a struggle to get started with a blank page and writing my tests before
starting to solve the problem. Like most things this took practice. By my last
two projects (the bonus homework) it was much easier to start right off with the
tests.  How exciting to see a passing test right off the bat! With more practice
you just might have one more test driven development disciple.  Can't wait for
next week!
