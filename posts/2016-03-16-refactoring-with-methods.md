#Refactoring with Methods

The refactoring process was a pretty good eye opener about writing readable
code. It was much easier to understand what a little 1-8 line code block does.
The largest benefit I see to refactoring is how easy it makes testing and
debugging.  Being able to isolate each process and ensure it is doing what you
and your test intend is powerful. It did make it difficult to follow the jumps
between methods when trying to get a grip of the whole picture. I will be
curious to see how this changes when we introduce objects and classes.

In terms of the data_validator, my approach was very similar to your
demo. I didn't get the refactoring of the selection of how many days are in the
month in question down to quite what you achieved, but for the time being I was
satisfied with my solution. refactoring this project made my code much simpler,
and so much more interesting to look at.

When working on the myspace name generator I was able to write code with
refactoring in mind.  In this case I was able to start with more methods broken
out but still went back and refactored some of the longer methods. I struggle
with not wanting my code (or my writing) to be great the first time. I have to
remind myself that I can get a solution that works and refactor later.
